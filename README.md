# Guessing Game

This is my version of the guessing game presented in chapter 2 of the Rust book. It's enhanced beyond the original version.

Currently it's a binary game playable in the terminal. My plan is to extract the core game into a library, and then utilize that library crate for the binary crate (which may feature some additions over the library such as difficulty selection that defines the secret number generation range and the max number of attempts).
